# Changes Made to Address High Priority Issues

## 1. TypeScript to JavaScript Migration

The TypeScript to JavaScript migration has been completed. The README.md has been updated to reflect this change. All TypeScript files have been converted to JavaScript with JSDoc comments for type safety.

## 2. Proper Routing Solution Implementation

A proper routing solution has been implemented using react-router-dom. This addresses the limitations of the previous approach:

- **Deep Linking**: Users can now bookmark or share links to specific pages
- **Browser History**: The browser's back and forward buttons now work as expected
- **Scalability**: The routing solution is now more maintainable and scalable

### Changes Made:

1. Modified `App.js` to use BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components
2. Created an AnimatedRoutes component to handle page transitions
3. Updated the Header component to use Link components instead of buttons with onClick handlers
4. Implemented proper route paths for all pages

### Installation Required:

Before running the application, you need to install the react-router-dom package:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

## 3. API Data Fetching and Error Handling Refactoring

The API data fetching and error handling logic has been refactored to reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.

### Changes Made:

1. Created a generic `useApiData` hook in `src/api/hooks/useApiData.js` that encapsulates:
   - Data fetching logic
   - Error handling with different strategies for development vs. production
   - Caching configuration
   - Mock data fallback (only in development)

2. Refactored all existing API hooks to use the generic hook:
   - useClientsData.js
   - useDashboardData.js
   - useInvoicesData.js
   - useOrdersData.js
   - useReportsData.js

3. Updated the hooks index.js file to export the new useApiData hook

### Benefits:

- Reduced code duplication
- Centralized error handling logic
- Different strategies for development vs. production
- Easier testing and maintenance
- More consistent API behavior across the application
